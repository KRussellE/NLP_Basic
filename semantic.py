print("ā Cat and monkey seem similar. Both of them are animals.;\nā Cat and banana does not have any significant similarity. I think because the cat usually does not eat banana. So, the model does not explicitly seem to recognise transitive relationships in its calculation;\nā Monkey and banana does have significant similarity. I think because the monkey likes to eat banana.\n")
